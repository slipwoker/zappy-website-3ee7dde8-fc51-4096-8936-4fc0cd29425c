This stage, known as NPI (New Product Introduction), holds many challenges that can determine the fate of the entire project. As an NPI expert in medical devices, I have repeatedly encountered companies with breakthrough technology that failed precisely at the industrialization and transition to serial production stage.",
  "case_studies_npi_process_p_7": "In the current case study, we accompanied a medical device company that developed an innovative imaging system. The prototype worked perfectly in the lab, but when they tried to manufacture the first ten units, significant performance deviations were discovered. The main problem was a mismatch between tolerances of components manufactured by hand versus those produced by mass plastic injection. An expert in development-to-production transfer in medical device systems knows how to identify these gaps at the design stage, but here real-time intervention was required.",
  "case_studies_npi_process_p_8": "The solution included rebuilding the Device Master Record (DMR) and defining stringent validation processes (IQ, OQ, PQ). We performed an updated risk analysis and implemented engineering changes designed to simplify assembly and reduce dependence on component skill. Leading the implementation of PLM systems for documentation and change management was an integral part of the process, as every change must be documented and approved to meet regulatory requirements (such as ISO 13485 and FDA QSR).",
  "case_studies_npi_process_p_9": "One of the main tools we used was Design for Manufacturability (DFM). By working closely with subcontractors, we managed to modify some parts to make them easier and cheaper to manufacture, without compromising clinical functionality. This is the added value of an NPI expert – the ability to see the big picture, from the engineering aspect to the business and regulatory aspects.",

The scrap rate dropped from 40% to less than 2%, and production cost per unit was reduced by 15%. The main conclusion from this case is that early integration of an NPI expert in the development process is not a \"luxury,\" but a necessary investment to prevent costly delays down the road. The development-to-production transfer process must be carefully planned, taking into account all regulatory and operational constraints.",

  "case_studies_plm_implementation_p_6": "In the digital age, engineering information management is the backbone of every high-tech company, particularly in the medical device field. The amount of documents, drawings, specifications, and quality tests required for each product is enormous. Without a central Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, companies find themselves drowning in a sea of conflicting versions, lost emails, and human errors. As an expert in leading PLM documentation and change management system implementations, I see how the transition to a computerized system transforms organizational culture from end to end.",
  "case_studies_plm_implementation_p_7": "The client in this case was a rapidly growing startup company that had moved from the development stage to initial sales phases. Engineering information was scattered between network folders, engineers' personal computers, and various ERP systems. The situation created real risk: the procurement department sometimes ordered components according to old drawing versions, leading to financial waste and production delays. Moreover, ahead of an ISO audit, it became clear that some engineering changes were not properly documented and not approved through the required signature chain.",
  "case_studies_plm_implementation_p_8": "PLM implementation is not just software installation; it's a process of defining work methodology. We started by mapping existing processes and identifying bottlenecks. We defined the Bill of Materials (BOM) hierarchically and correctly, and established workflows for document approval and Engineering Change Orders (ECO). An NPI expert in medical devices understands how the system must serve not only engineers, but also quality, regulatory, and manufacturing departments.",
  "case_studies_plm_implementation_p_9": "The implementation included comprehensive training for different teams and setting precise access permissions. One of the biggest challenges was migrating historical data – filtering relevant information and transferring it to the new system in a clean and verified manner. The PLM system became the organization's 'Single Source of Truth'.",
  "case_studies_regulatory_changes_p_5": "Happily created by&nbsp;Zappy",
  "case_studies_regulatory_changes_p_6": "Obtaining initial regulatory approval (such as 510(k) or CE approval) is a tremendous achievement for any medical device company. However, the real challenge often begins after that, when the need arises to make changes to the product. These changes can stem from various reasons: supplier changes, component obsolescence, performance improvements, or market feedback. As an expert in obtaining regulatory approvals for design changes in the medical device field, I frequently encounter companies' fear of making necessary changes due to concern about losing existing approval.",
  "case_studies_regulatory_changes_p_7": "In this case, we worked with a manufacturer of infusion pumps. One of the critical electronic components in the pump went End of Life, and the company was forced to find an alternative. The available alternative required a change to the printed circuit board (PCB) and a minor software update. The concern was that the change would be considered a 'substantial change' requiring resubmission to the FDA, an expensive and lengthy process. This is where expertise in understanding the nuances of regulation comes into play. Not every change requires resubmission, but every change requires documentation and proof that safety and effectiveness have not been compromised.",
  "case_studies_regulatory_changes_p_8": "We led a structured change assessment process (Letter to File). The process included comprehensive risk analysis to ensure the new component does not present new risks or change the existing risk profile. We conducted comprehensive verification testing to compare performance between the old and new components. Leading the implementation of PLM documentation and change management systems was critical in this case, as it allowed us to accurately track the impact of the change on all device subsystems and ensure all relevant documents were updated.",
  "case_studies_regulatory_changes_p_9": "The file we prepared included clear engineering justification, comparative test results, and regulatory analysis based on FDA guidance for deciding when to submit a new 510(k) (Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device). The reasoned conclusion was that the change does not require a new submission, but only internal documentation.",

  "case_studies_plm_implementation_p_10": "Today, every product change is managed transparently and in a controlled manner. Engineering Change Order (ECO) processing time was reduced by 40%, and purchasing errors due to incorrect versions were completely eliminated. In the last ISO audit, the auditor praised the level of control in documentation and configuration management. PLM implementation enabled the company to scale up confidently, knowing their information infrastructure is stable and supports the most stringent regulatory requirements.",

The case highlights the importance of a regulatory expert who also understands the engineering and operational aspects. The ability to bridge between technical requirements and legal requirements is the key to managing healthy and long-term product life in our regulated industry.",
